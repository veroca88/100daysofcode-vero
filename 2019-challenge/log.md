# 100 Days Of Code - Log

# DAY 1 02/12/2019.
**Today Progress** Today Progress: I practiced the variation of css: flex and grid. I did two differents ways to responsive web. Also I did an js exercise to practice more. 
**Thoughts** This challenge will prod me to achieve my goals and improve my knowledge in programming. 
# DAY 2 02/13/2019.
**Today Progress** I worked with grid nested HTML and CSS to made the calculator, today, I started the chapter of Front End Libraries on FreeCodeCamp, also I re-checked some exercises of javascript on my repository of github exercises-js-prctc.
**Thoughts** I need to practice more and more, however after this months doing the FreeCodeCamp course I feel motivated because I can resolve js exercises with more confidence.
# DAY 3 02/14/2019.
**Today Progress** I worked with some javascript exercises, I started using a board to understand better the challenges in javascript and it's help me a lot... 
**Thoughts** I'm still fighting with one problem but I'm in the correct path, It's hard sometimes when you want to explain something but can't find the corrects words
# DAY 4 02/15/2019.
**Today Progress** I worked today on exercise where I have to display a elements of array, all the elements have to be enumerated with ordinal form (st, nd, tr, th) I worked with the arithmetic operator reminder %, I read about it and also I did some exercises about computer science fundamentals.
**Thoughts** When an exercises is challenging I search the most I can to understand sometimes I feel stuck but then when finally I got the solution it's great.
# DAY 5 02/16/2019.
 **Today Progress** I worked in javascript exercises, Write a JavaScript program to perform a binary search, I completed it, also I tryed shuffle an array, but in this exercise I'm stuck, I've read some solutions but I need to understand every step to keep going... After one hour more I finally did it!!
 **Thoughts** While I read more about computer science fundamentals, algorithms and some terms more technics as Big O notation I feel motivated and sometimes I feel exausted but I'm keep doing more javascript exercises, I think I have many things to learn, I need to take advantage of the time.
# DAY 6 02/17/2019.
**Today Progress** I did some exercises of mathematical functions, and in free code camp I'm in the Intermediate Algorithms: Smallest Common Multiple, I read a lot of how to do that exercises and finally I got it.
**Thoughts** I think sometimes I spend to much time doing an exercises, I need to improve my time and also need to improve my code.
# DAY 7 02/18/2019.
**Today Progress** I re-checked the last code because I need to improve the time of my code, I started to read Euclidean Algorithms but I don't get it yet, so I changed to study some intervals and interval notation functions.
**Thoughts** It's difficult when I've tried to understand an algorithm and I want to apply in coding, sometimes I need someone to explain me or I have to read and practice more in that challenge.
# DAY 8 02/19/19.
**Today Progress** I searched for different ways to do the last exercise because my code was too long, the problem was there were advance way to get it but I want to understand the code to keep going with other one, so I tried several times, first, I created a function it takes the prime numbers, inside the principal function but then I couldn't find how to explain the next step so I tried again, finally I found someone who could explain me!!
**Thoughts** I think the self-education it's challenging because sometimes you need a teacher a mentor or friend who could help you. Tutorials sometimes help but sometimes not.
# Day 9 02/20/19. 
**Today Progress** Today I worked in different exercises of javascript, the first one was about iterate through and remove element from a function, lucky me yesterday I studied how function (mathematical) works, it helped me a lot. The next exercise was about to compute the sum of each individual index of two differents arrays... I'm still working on it.
**Thoughts** Today was a good day, I did two exercises, one of them despite its difficult I got it. I'm working in the second one...
# Day 10 02/21/2019!!
**Today Progress** Today I finished my last code, I loved it because I'm used while, for and push, I understood why sometimes when I used push didn't work, was a great day.  I did FreeCode Camp exercises,   I'm in the last of javascript.
**Thoughts** Today was a great day, I learn a little bit, some exercise don't need to be so difficult to test you and this one was a great practice.
# Day 11 02/22/2019!!
**Today Progress** I read about recursion in javascript, the concept, uses and saw some examples. I did some exercises about it. The first one was about mathematical factorial number, I started from scratch and then step by step I was creating the code. The second exercise was one of the FreeCodeCamp named "Seamroller" I tried several times but I couldn't reach the solucion so I search one line tips, finally I found and excellent explanation that give me the complete image.
**Thoughts** Despite I did two exercises of recursion in javascript I need to practice more and more, I'm going to follow the advice of start from little challenge and understand completly and then start with another a little bit more challenging.
# DAY 12 02/23/2019!!
**Today Progress** I read about the importance of tail call optimization when we are using recursive functions and if you have fear to lost in an infinity loop there are a way to protect you with a trampoline functions, of this specific theme there are many opinions of both sides, use this type of functions slows your own function and it's no productive. I re-write my last code, I apply recursive function.
**Thoughts** Since the first day you started to learn to code, everybody told you that you must be careful with the infinity loops and then I knew recursive functions and understand that some risks are necessary.
# DAY 13 02/24/2019!!
**Today Progress** I practiced how to make a gradient background, I applied it to my web page, also I did an exercise in javascript, it took me time, I did some research to solve it. 
**Thoughts** Read about how to do some exercises help me to see other points of view and show me new paths.
# DAY 14 02/25/2019!!
**Today Progress** Today I did two exercises of javascript, the first one taught me new things, I knew some of them but I didn't know how to apply so that exercise helps me a lot. I firm up my knowledge about flatten an array with the second exercise.
**Thoughts** I think while I did more exercises and repeat each of them I firm up my knowledge, I love it when I can do an exercise without problem.
# DAY 15 02/26/2019!!
**Today Progress** Today I did two exercises of javascript, it was challenging however I complete both of them. I know more about work with objects and arras, flatten array and use forEach metod. Also I practice different selectors in css using a program named CSS diner.
**Thoughts** More exercises of javascript it's the best way to achieve my goals, I have too much to earn but each day I find new thing and different way to do some code.
# DAY 16 02/27/2019!!
**Today Progress** Today I did a different type of exercise, this one is more focus to the real world, I did to an information input masked it. I used regular expression, also I tried to join to my HTML but I didn't have success. Also I did freecodecamp exercise it was about Return an English translated sentence of the passed binary string.
**Thoughts** I want to pass this chapter and start in the bootstrap I'm exited about how I can join HTML with javascript.
# DAY 17 02/28/2019!!
**Today Progress** Today I only did one exercise on freecodecamp and review the last exercise, Today I don't have much time.
**Thoughts** today for me wasn't a great progress, I think for code I need more time, tomorrow I'm goinog to spend the doble of the time.
# DAY 18 03/02/2019
**Today Progress** Today I worked in exercises of javascript, the first one was about create a function to find the difference of two arrays, this exercise was new in the way to solve so it helped me a lot. I'm still working on the second one, function to return the numbers of truthy.
**Thoughts** Today was a good day, I did two exercises, one of them despite its difficult it teach me a lot. I'm working in the second one...
# DAY 19 03/03/2019
**Today Progress** I re-checked the last code because I need understand how that methonds works, I did an exercise of javascript and an exercise of FreeCodeCamp.        
**Thoughts** I've tried to understand that methods to know how to apply when I want to apply in coding, sometimes I need someone to explain me or I have to read and practice more in that challenge.
# DAY 20 03/04/2019
**Today Progress** Today I did exercise of javascript, it taught me new things about objects, iterate and search inside them, I knew some of it but I didn't know how to get data, this exercise helps me a lot.
**Thoughts** I think while I repeat exercises and did a lot of them without searching on line I will lear more, I love when I can do an exercise with confidence.
# DAY 21 03/05/2019
**Today Progress** I found this application called SoloLearn I did a lot practice in it, some basic concepts and how to join HTML with Javascript.
**Thoughts** I'm feel motivated when I respond a question about js or html with confidence, it let me know that I must to keep going.
# DAY 22 03/06/2019
**Today Progress** I converted ordinal numbers in roman numbers and started to do the next exercise about Caesars Cipher, I tried until nigth but I couldn't solve it.
**Thoughts** I need to understand completly the most common function/methods for that I'm going to do a cheat sheet.
