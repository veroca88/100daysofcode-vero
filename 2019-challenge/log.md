# 100 Days Of Code - Log

DAY 1 02/12/2019.
**Today Progress** Today Progress: I practiced the variation of css: flex and grid. I did two differents ways to responsive web. Also I did an js exercise to practice more. 
**Thoughts** This challenge will prod me to achieve my goals and improve my knowledge in programming. 
DAY 2 02/13/2019.
**Today Progress** I worked with grid nested HTML and CSS to made the calculator, today, I started the chapter of Front End Libraries on FreeCodeCamp, also I re-checked some exercises of javascript on my repository of github exercises-js-prctc.
**Thoughts** I need to practice more and more, however after this months doing the FreeCodeCamp course I feel motivated because I can resolve js exercises with more confidence.
DAY 3 02/14/2019.
**Today Progress** I worked with some javascript exercises, I started using a board to understand better the challenges in javascript and it's help me a lot... 
**Thoughts** I'm still fighting with one problem but I'm in the correct path, It's hard sometimes when you want to explain something but can't find the corrects words
DAY 4 02/15/2019.
**Today Progress** I worked today on exercise where I have to display a elements of array, all the elements have to be enumerated with ordinal form (st, nd, tr, th) I worked with the arithmetic operator reminder %, I read about it and also I did some exercises about computer science fundamentals.
**Thoughts** When an exercises is challenging I search the most I can to understand sometimes I feel stuck but then when finally I got the solution it's great.
 DAY 5 02/16/2019.
 **Today Progress** I worked in javascript exercises, Write a JavaScript program to perform a binary search, I completed it, also I tryed shuffle an array, but in this exercise I'm stuck, I've read some solutions but I need to understand every step to keep going... After one hour more I finally did it!!
 **Thoughts** While I read more about computer science fundamentals, algorithms and some terms more technics as Big O notation I feel motivated and sometimes I feel exausted but I'm keep doing more javascript exercises, I think I have many things to learn, I need to take advantage of the time.
 DAY 6 02/17/2019.
**Today Progress** I did some exercises of mathematical functions, and in free code camp I'm in the Intermediate Algorithms: Smallest Common Multiple, I read a lot of how to do that exercises and finally I got it.
**Thoughts** I think sometimes I spend to much time doing an exercises, I need to improve my time and also need to improve my code.
