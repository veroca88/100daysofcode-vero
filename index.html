      <strong>DAY 1 09/16/2018.</strong> **Thoughts** Today i feel a little lost because i dont know how to start, then
      couple of hours
      thinking, i decided to build a web page with many projects inside using javascript, html and css or maybe during
      the challenge i will make some changes. **Today Progress** Work in design of the page, header, navigation bar and
      radio button.

      <strong>DAY 2 09/17/2018.</strong> **Thoughts** Today i decide to make a little harder for me this challege, it
      is good to put yourself in new places and leave the comfort zone. **Today Progress** Im creating a Measurement
      Table, in one column are the body measure of the user and in the next column will be that measure divided for 4,
      but I'm stuck in this point.

      <strong>DAY 3 09/18/2018.</strong> **Thoughts** I feel like a quicksand, with the table i still with problem, I'm going to pause that project and start with another, in the FreeCodeCamp i started ES6 i think i need study more to do better the project of the table... the positive side today read a lot and learned new tips, but isn't enough, tomorrow i review the concepts and utilization of each. 
      **Today Progress** Not much, try a lot but still without success.

      <strong>DAY 4 09/20/2018.</strong> **Thoughts** Yesterday i did exercises in FreeCodeCamp, but i didn't have time to practice and post... today i felt creative and I could organize a little better to have time and continue with the challenge. 
      **Today Progress** Did some animation base on the examples of HTML y really love play with those animation, change color, shape and iteration. Maybe i need to search some project of animation to practice more.

      <strong>DAY 5 09/21/2018.</strong> **Thoughts** Today i feel motivated to do more and discover paths to do thing better, its nice to see the progress and see the obstacles that are presented to you along the way.
      **Today Progress** Did 3 animation with differents directions and images, create some new space for them.
