      <h1>First Day!</h1>
      <p> Today Progress: I practiced the variation of css: flex and grid. I did two differents ways to responsive web. Also I did an js exercise to practice more. 
        Thoughts: This challenge will prod me to achieve my goals and improve my knowledge in programming. </p>
      <h2>Second Day!!</h2>
      <p> Today Progress: I worked with grid nested HTML and CSS to made the calculator, today, I started the chapter of Front End Libraries on FreeCodeCamp, also I re-checked some exercises of javascript on my repository of github exercises-js-prctc.
        Thoughts: I need to practice more and more, however after this months doing the FreeCodeCamp course I feel motivated because I can resolve js exercises with more confidence.
      </p>
      <h2>Third Day!!</h2>
      <p> Today Progress: I worked with some javascript exercises, I started using a board to understand better the challenges in javascript and it's help me a lot... 
        Thoughts: I'm still fighting with one problem but I'm in the correct path, It's hard sometimes when you want to explain something but can't find the corrects words</p>
        <h2>Fourth Day!</h2>
        <p> Today Progress: I worked today on exercise where I have to display a elements of array, all the elements have to be enumerated with ordinal form (st, nd, tr, th) I worked with the arithmetic operator reminder %, I read about it and also I did some exercises about computer science fundamentals. 
        Thoughts: When an exercises is challenging I search the most I can to understand sometimes I feel stuck but then when finally I got the solution it's great. </p>
        <h2>Day Five!!</h2>
        <p> Today Progress: I worked in javascript exercises, Write a JavaScript program to perform a binary search, I completed it, also I tryed shuffle an array, but in this exercise I'm stuck, I've read some solutions but I need to understand every step to keep going... After one hour more I finally did it!! 
        Thoughts: While I read more about computer science fundamentals, algorithms and some terms more technics as Big O notation I feel motivated and sometimes I feel exausted but I'm keep doing more javascript exercises, I think I have many things to learn, I need to take advantage of the time. </p>
        <h2>Day Six!!</h2>
        <p> Today Progress: I did some exercises of mathematical functions, and in free code camp I'm in the Intermediate Algorithms: Smallest Common Multiple, I read a lot of how to do that exercises and finally I got it.
        Thoughts: I think sometime I spent to much time doing an exercises, I need to improve my time and also need to improve my code.
        </p>
        <h2>Day Seven!!</h2>
        <p>Today Progress: I re-checked the last code because I need to improve the time of my code, I started to read Euclidean Algorithms but I don't get it yet, so I changed to study some intervals and interval notation functions.
        Thoughts: It's difficult when I've tried to understand an algorithm and I want to apply in coding, sometimes I need someone to explain me or I have to read and practice more in that challenge.</p>
        <h2>DAY 8 02/19/19.</h2>
        <p>Today Progress: I searched for different ways to do the last exercise because my code was too long, the problem was there were advance way to get it but I want to understand the code to keep going with other one, so I tried several times, first, I created a function it takes the prime numbers, inside the principal function but then I couldn't find how to explain the next step so I tried again, finally I found someone who could explain me!!
        Thoughts: I think the self-education it's challenging because sometimes you need a teacher a mentor or friend who could help you. Tutorials sometimes help but sometimes not.
