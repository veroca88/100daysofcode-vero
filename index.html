    <h2> Coding? </h2>
    <p id="introduction">Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program for accomplishing a
      specific computing task. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling
      algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming
      language (commonly referred to as coding[1][2]). The source code of a program is written in one or more
      programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the
      performance of a task for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in
      several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal
      logic.

      Related tasks include testing, debugging, maintaining a program's source code, implementation of build systems,
      and management of derived artifacts such as machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of
      the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term
      programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of source code. Software engineering
      combines engineering techniques with software development practices.</p>

    This project born from the desire to be able to practice what i learned everyday.
    <p>
      <strong>DAY 1 09/15/2018.</strong> **Thoughts** Today i feel a little lost because i dont know how to start, then couple of hours
      thinking, i decided to build a web page with many projects inside using javascript, html and css or maybe during
      the challenge i will make some changes. **Today Progress** Work in design of the page, header, navigation bar and
      radio button.
