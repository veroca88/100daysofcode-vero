DAY 1 09/15/2018.
**Thoughts** Today i feel a little lost because i dont know how to start, then couple of hours thinking, i decided to build a web page with many projects inside using javascript, html and css or maybe during the challenge i will make some changes. 
**Today Progress** Work in design of the page, header, home, experiences, navigation bar and radio button.
DAY 2 09/17/2018.
**Thoughts** Today i decide to make a little harder for me this challege, it is good to put yourself in new places and leave the comfort zone. 
**Today Progress** Im creating a Measurement Table, in one column are the body measure of the user and in the next column will be that measure divided for 4, but I'm stuck in this point.
DAY 3 09/18/2018. 
**Thoughts** I feel like a quicksand, with the table i still with problem, I'm going to pause that project and start with another, in the FreeCodeCamp i started ES6 i think i need study more to do better the project of the table... the positive side today read a lot and learned new tips, but isn't enough, tomorrow i review the concepts and utilization of each. 
**Today Progress** Not much, try a lot but still without success.
DAY 4 09/20/2018. 
**Thoughts** Yesterday i did exercises in FreeCodeCamp, but i didn't have time to practice and post... today i felt creative and I could organize a little better to have time and continue with the challenge. 
**Today Progress** Did some animation base on the examples of HTML y really love play with those animation, change color, shape and iteration. Maybe i need to search some project of animation to practice more.
DAY 5 09/21/2018.
**Thoughts** Today i feel motivated to do more and discover paths to do thing better, its nice to see the progress and see the obstacles that are presented to you along the way.
**Today Progress** Did 3 animation with differents directions and images, create some new space for them.
